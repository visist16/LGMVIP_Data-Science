![Stock Market](stock_market.jpg)

## Overview

This notebook is part of the LGMVIP Data Science Internship Task 2. In this project, we delve into time series data analysis and stock price prediction using Python. The main focus is on analyzing the stock market, particularly the technology giants: Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. By leveraging various Python libraries and techniques, we aim to extract valuable insights from historical stock data and create a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Introduction

Time series data, a sequence of data points ordered by time, is prevalent in various domains. Understanding and analyzing such data is fundamental for data analysts and data scientists. In this project, we utilize the power of Python and data visualization libraries to explore and analyze stock market data.

## Questions Explored

Throughout this project, we aim to answer the following questions:

1. **Change in Stock Price**: Visualize the changes in stock prices of the selected technology companies over time.
2. **Daily Stock Return**: Calculate and analyze the daily average returns of the stocks.
3. **Moving Averages**: Calculate and visualize the moving averages of the stock prices.
4. **Stock Correlation**: Examine the correlation between the stock prices of different companies.
5. **Risk Assessment**: Assess the investment risk associated with specific stocks.
6. **Stock Price Prediction**: Utilize LSTM neural networks to predict future stock prices.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook and code successfully, ensure you have the following libraries and tools:

- Python (version XYZ)
- Jupyter Notebook
- yfinance
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow (for LSTM)

## Installation

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook Time_Series_Stock_Prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to explore the data, analyze the stocks, and run the LSTM model for stock price prediction.
Results
The notebook provides detailed insights into the historical stock data of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Visualizations help understand stock price trends, correlations, and risk assessments. The LSTM model's predictions for future stock prices offer a glimpse into potential price movements.
